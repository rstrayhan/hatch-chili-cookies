A set of PowerShell scripts to make the Admin of Exchange a little bit easier.

The script for Distribution List has 3 sections. As of 9/26, only section 1 is done. While access to the other 2 menus is there, they will not work.

The script for Email and Calender admin is under going a full overhaul AFTER the DL script is complete.
